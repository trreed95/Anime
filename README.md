# Anime Predictions
Heather Garcia and Tyler Reed

# Backgound
This project is from our MSDA program at UTSA. Our original challenge was to find a real-world problem that impacts us and use data driven methodologies to find a solution to the problem.

# Identify a problem.
Find a real-world data set to solve it
Survey prior literature to look at other attempts to solve this problem
Build and iterate on your solution.
Generate and refine conclusions

# Our Approach
To find a real world problem, we started out by looking for something that we knew about but did not have extensive research into it. We found the Anime dataset and realized both of us have an interest in Anime through our children. We then proceded to design a hypothesis based upon a dataset that we found on Kaggle. We then looked for more datasets to include into our research.

# Original Dataset
Kaggle Datasets at: https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist/home
We used the original data in these zips: 
1. AnimeList.csv
2. UserAnimeList.csv
3. UserList.csv
